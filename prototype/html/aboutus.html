            <p>In this project, we have created a meeting place where teachers can find a second examiner for their
                course.
                After logging in, teachers have the opportunity to create a profile, then post a job advertisement,
                and see
                other people's job advertisements.
                They are able to register a request for a second examiner with details about the course, the dates,
                the expected workload and see for which own requests other teachers have suggested themselves as
                potential
                second examiners,
                suggest themselves as the second examiner for one or more of the published requests, classify a
                request with
                a tag, accept a suggestion and more.
                The administrators can add, update and delete users. They can also create user accounts for teachers
                and
                modify user accounts for teachers.</p>
