## About the project
The goal of the project is to create a system where all employees in the college / university sector will be able to find examiners for upcoming exams. Since the government has decided that there will be a 2-sensor solution. Today's solution is to call around to potential sensors and spend a lot of unnecessary time on it.

## :pencil2: Course Content
As long it is practically possible, the project assignments will be given by the companies the study programme is cooperating with or by internal product owners. Students, over different meetings with the product owner, will have to go through the different stages or phases of the development of a web project, going from the conceptualisation of the problem and its solution to its implementation and deployment in a production environment. Topics This is a practical course that supplements or continues from the ordinary course portfolio in the programme and, thus, most of the background knowledge has been introduced in previous courses. However, students will have to learn on their own one of the top trending JavaScript frameworks suitable for solving the problem presented by the product owner.

## :pencil2: Learning Outcome
### Knowledge:
The aim is for the students to be better web developers with practical experience in the industry, as well as typical approaches to new, and anticipated future methods and technologies (including web components) for development of active web solutions.

### Skills:
After completing this course, the students will be able to: 
* Use JavaScript frameworks as a tool for solving complex problems. 
* Communicate with relevant user groups and map their wishes and needs. 
* Participate as an effective member of a self-organising project group that manages its own work and works systematically towards a common goal. 
* To plan and contribute effectively to an iterative design and development process over time. 
* Help preventing inefficiencies, conflicts and counterproductive group behaviour, and handle problems in a constructive way. 
* Communicate with relevant user groups and map their wishes and needs. 
* Apply insights from user studies to design a good and customised product. 

### General competence:
After the completion of this course, the students will be able to reflect on the pros and cons of different architectures and web technologies. They will have acquired a general competence on analysing the needs and the context of a problem conceptualising a solution that provides a detailed description of the design and the technological background for fulfilling the needs and constrains of the project using front-end technologies for implement a MVP They will also be able to work within a collaborative environment being part of a team disseminate and communicate the results of their projects
